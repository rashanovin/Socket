# Python Socket Project with Qt Designer and Websocket
This is a Python project that uses [Qt designer](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtdesigner-manual.html) to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for a socket application that communicates over a [websockets](https://websockets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). The GUI allows the user to connect to a websocket server, send messages to the server, and receive messages from the server.
The project includes a main.py file that launches the GUI, as well as a mainwindow.ui file that can be modified using Qt Designer to customize the look and feel of the GUI. The project also includes a mainwindow.py file that is automatically generated by Qt Designer and provides the Python code for the GUI.
​
The Python socket project with Qt Designer and Websocket allows developers to quickly and easily create socket applications with a graphical user interface. The project uses the PyQt5 library to provide a powerful and flexible GUI toolkit, and the websockets library to handle communication over a websocket.
## Appendix
​
This project is made of two parts, application and backend.  [Qt designer](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtdesigner-manual.html) is used for the application of this project, whose code structure is implemented in 2 functions: setupUi, and retranslateUi.
But for the back-end part of our project, we used the [websockets](https://websockets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library, whose codes can be seen inside the sendKey function.
​
​
## Documentation
To build and implement this project, we used these packages and programs from the beginning:
 - [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/)
  - [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/#:~:text=PyQt5%20is%20a%20comprehensive%20set,platforms%20including%20iOS%20and%20Android.)
   - [PyQt5.QtWidgets](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/pyqt-basic-widgets/)
 - [websockets](https://websockets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
​
​
​
## Installation
​
To install the required dependencies,we run the following command:
​
```bash
  pip install pyqt5
  pip install websocket-client
  
```
    
## Usage
To run the program, we execute the following command:
​
```javascript
python main.py
```
​
This will launch the GUI and display a window with a send button. To connect to the socket server, write text in the box and click the send button. Or press the Enter button on the keyboard.
​
​
## Customization
The GUI can be customized by modifying the mainwindow.ui file using Qt Designer. To open the file in Qt Designer, run the following command:
​
```bash
  designer mainwindow.ui
  
```
or run file in Qt Designer
​
Make any desired changes to the GUI, save the file, and then regenerate the Python code by running the following command:
​
```bash
  pyuic5 mainwindow.ui -o mainwindow.py
  
```
​
​
## Prerequisites 
​
```bash
    from websocket import create_connection
    from PyQt5 import QtCore, QtGui, QtWidgets
​
    import json
  
```
​
## Troubleshooting Common Issues
The troubleshooting section of the README file provides solutions for several common issues that users may encounter when running the project, such as missing dependencies or compatibility issues between modules.
​
If you encounter an issue that is not covered in the troubleshooting section, you can try searching for a solution online, or contacting the project maintainer for assistance.
​
- for example:
Error: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'websockets'"
This error occurs when the websockets module is not installed on your system. To install the module, run the following command:
​
```bash
pip install websockets
  
```
​

​
* **Saves time and effort**: The project provides a quick and easy way to create a socket application with a GUI, saving developers time and effort that would otherwise be spent on manual coding.
* **Reduces complexity**: Using a GUI can make the application less complex and easier to use, reducing the risk of errors and making it more accessible to users who are not familiar with command-line interfaces.
* **Provides a professional look**: A GUI can provide a more polished and professional look to the application, which can be important for applications that are intended for public use or distribution.
* **Customizable to meet specific needs**: The ability to customize the GUI using Qt Designer allows developers to create an application that meets their specific needs and requirements.
​
## Project Limitations
While the Python socket project with Qt Designer and Websocket provides many benefits, there are also some limitations to consider:
​
Limited to socket applications: The project is specifically designed for socket applications that communicate over a websocket, and may not be suitable for other types of applications.
Requires some knowledge of Python and Qt Designer: While the project is designed to be accessible to beginners, it does require some knowledge of Python and Qt Designer to fully utilize its features.
May require additional customization: While the project provides a customizable GUI, developers may still need to make additional customizations to the Python code to fully meet their specific needs and requirements.

## FAQ
​
## Why Use a GUI for Socket Applications?
​
Socket applications are typically run from the command line, which can make them difficult to use and navigate for non-technical users. A graphical user interface provides a more intuitive and user-friendly way to interact with the application, making it easier for users to understand what's happening and how to use the application.
​
In addition, a GUI can provide a more polished and professional look to the application, which can be important for applications that are intended for public use or distribution.
## How to Customize the GUI
​
The GUI for this project can be customized using Qt Designer, which is a powerful and easy-to-use GUI design tool. To modify the GUI using Qt Designer, simply open the mainwindow.ui file in Qt Designer and make any desired changes to the layout, widgets, or properties. Once you've made your changes, save the file and then regenerate the Python code by running the pyuic5 command, as described in the installation section of the README file.
